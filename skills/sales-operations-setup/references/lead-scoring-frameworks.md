# Lead Scoring Frameworks

## Overview
Lead scoring helps prioritize leads based on their likelihood to convert and potential value. This document outlines common frameworks used in sales operations.

## BANT Framework

**Budget** - Does the prospect have budget allocated?
- Score: 0-25 points
- Questions: "What budget have you allocated?" "When does your fiscal year reset?"

**Authority** - Is this person a decision-maker?
- Score: 0-25 points
- Questions: "Who else will be involved in this decision?" "What's your role in the evaluation process?"

**Need** - Does the prospect have a clear need/pain point?
- Score: 0-25 points
- Questions: "What challenges are you facing?" "What happens if you don't solve this?"

**Timeline** - When do they plan to make a decision?
- Score: 0-25 points
- Questions: "When do you need this implemented?" "What's driving the timeline?"

**Total Score: 0-100**
- 75-100: Hot lead (contact within 24 hours)
- 50-74: Warm lead (contact within 3 days)
- 25-49: Cold lead (nurture campaign)
- 0-24: Disqualified

## Implementation Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with BANT or CHAMP, add complexity later
2. **Align Sales/Marketing**: Get agreement on scoring criteria
3. **Test and Iterate**: Review conversions and adjust weights
4. **Regular Review**: Update scoring quarterly based on data
5. **Automate**: Use CRM workflows to score automatically
6. **Decay Scores**: Reduce scores over time if no engagement
7. **Negative Scoring**: Subtract points for disqualifying factors
8. **Threshold Setting**: Define clear handoff points between teams

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Over-complicating: Too many criteria make scoring unusable
- Set and forget: Scoring models need regular updates
- Ignoring feedback: Sales team input is critical
- Pure automation: Review high-value leads manually
- No decay: Old leads stay scored high forever
- Missing alignment: Sales and marketing disagree on criteria
