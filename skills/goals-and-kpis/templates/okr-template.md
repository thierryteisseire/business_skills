## End-of-Quarter Scoring Guide

### How to Score Key Results

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1.0 | Fully achieved | 100% or more of target |
| 0.7 – 0.9 | Strong progress | On track, stretch achieved |
| 0.4 – 0.6 | Partial | Made progress but fell short |
| 0.1 – 0.3 | Minimal | Limited progress |
| 0.0 | No progress | Did not move the needle |

### How to Score Objectives

**Objective Score** = Average of Key Result scores

| Avg Score | Grade | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| 0.7 – 1.0 | Excellent | Ambitious target met — review if ambitious enough |
| 0.4 – 0.6 | Good | Progress made, areas to improve |
| 0.0 – 0.3 | Needs attention | Major gaps — diagnose root cause |

### Scoring Best Practices

1. **Score honestly** — OKRs are not tied to comp
2. **Score against the target**, not against effort
3. **A 0.7 average is ideal** — it means targets were stretch
4. **All 1.0s = sandbag** — targets weren't ambitious enough
5. **All 0.3s = misalignment** — goals or resources were wrong
6. **Include qualitative notes** — numbers don't tell the whole story

## Quarterly OKR Review Template

### 1. Review Last Quarter (30 min)

For each OKR:
- What was the score?
- What went well?
- What didn't work?
- What did we learn?
- What should we carry forward?

### 2. Set Next Quarter (60 min)

- Review company priorities (any changes from last quarter?)
- Draft 3-5 Objectives
- Define 3-5 Key Results per Objective
- Assign owners
- Identify dependencies
- Set confidence levels

### 3. Alignment Check (30 min)

- Do department OKRs ladder to company OKRs?
- Are there orphan goals (no connection up)?
- Are there conflicting goals across departments?
- Do we have the right resources allocated?

### 4. Communication Plan (15 min)

- Who needs to know?
- How will we communicate?
- Where will OKRs live (Notion, Asana, Google Docs, etc.)?
- When is the first weekly check-in?
