## Notes

- **"Baseline"** as a target means: measure first, set targets next quarter once you have data
- **Implementation Date** is critical — don't track everything at once; phase in over 2-3 quarters
- **Next Steps** should be reviewed weekly until the KPI is operational
- Shared metrics between functions (e.g., Product × Engineering) should have a single DRI
- Update the Metrics Map quarterly alongside the Goal Map review
