## Framework Deep Dives

### OKR — Objectives & Key Results

**Origin**: Intel (Andy Grove, 1970s), popularised by Google (John Doerr, 1999)

**Structure**:
```
Objective: [Qualitative, inspiring, time-bound]
  KR 1: [Quantitative metric] — Current: X → Target: Y
  KR 2: [Quantitative metric] — Current: X → Target: Y
  KR 3: [Quantitative metric] — Current: X → Target: Y
```

**Rules**:
- 3-5 Objectives per level (company, department, team, individual)
- 3-5 Key Results per Objective
- Key Results are measurable and time-bound
- Scoring: 0.0 – 1.0 scale; 0.7 is "good" (stretch targets)
- Not tied to compensation (to encourage ambition)
- Set quarterly with weekly check-ins

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Drives focus and ambition
- ✅ Aligns teams to company priorities
- ✅ Weekly rhythm keeps goals alive
- ✅ Transparent (everyone sees all OKRs)

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Can feel arbitrary if poorly set
- ❌ Requires discipline to run check-ins
- ❌ The "stretch" concept confuses newcomers
- ❌ Not ideal for compliance or operational roles

**Best for**: High-growth companies that value ambition, transparency, and cross-functional alignment.

### SMART Goals

**Origin**: George T. Doran (1981)

**Structure**:
```
Goal: [Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound statement]
  - Specific: What exactly will you accomplish?
  - Measurable: How will you know you succeeded?
  - Achievable: Is this realistic given resources?
  - Relevant: Does this align to business priorities?
  - Time-bound: By when?
```

**Rules**:
- Each goal is a complete, self-contained statement
- Typically set annually or semi-annually
- Often tied to performance reviews and compensation
- Individual focus (not always cascaded)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Simple to understand and teach
- ✅ Works for any role or function
- ✅ Good for personal development plans
- ✅ Easy to evaluate (met / not met)

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Encourages conservative targets (since tied to comp)
- ❌ Weak at cross-team alignment
- ❌ Annual cadence too slow for fast-moving orgs
- ❌ No inherent prioritisation mechanism

**Best for**: Traditional organisations, individual performance plans, or as a complement to OKRs.

### Balanced Scorecard (BSC)

**Origin**: Robert Kaplan & David Norton (1992)

**Structure** (4 Perspectives):
```
Financial Perspective
  └─ Objectives → Measures → Targets → Initiatives

Customer Perspective
  └─ Objectives → Measures → Targets → Initiatives

Internal Processes Perspective
  └─ Objectives → Measures → Targets → Initiatives

Learning & Growth Perspective
  └─ Objectives → Measures → Targets → Initiatives
```

**Rules**:
- Strategy map links perspectives via cause-and-effect
- Each perspective has 3-5 strategic objectives
- Each objective has measures, targets, and initiatives
- Annual cadence with monthly/quarterly reporting
- Designed for enterprise strategic management

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Holistic view (not just financial)
- ✅ Cause-and-effect thinking
- ✅ Strong strategic alignment
- ✅ Well-suited for board reporting

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Complex to set up and maintain
- ❌ Heavy documentation requirements
- ❌ Annual cadence too slow for startups
- ❌ Can become a reporting exercise, not a management tool

**Best for**: Large enterprises, consulting engagements, or companies needing structured strategy execution.

---

### V2MOM (Salesforce)

**Origin**: Marc Benioff, Salesforce (1999)

**Structure**:
```
Vision:     What do you want to achieve?
Values:     What principles guide your actions?
Methods:    What will you do to get there?
Obstacles:  What could prevent success?
Measures:   How will you know you succeeded?
```

**Rules**:
- CEO writes company V2MOM first
- Every employee writes their own (aligned to manager's)
- Updated annually with quarterly refreshes
- Transparent: all V2MOMs visible to everyone
- Prioritised: Methods and Measures ranked 1, 2, 3…

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Easy to understand
- ✅ Forces prioritisation
- ✅ Includes obstacle identification (proactive risk)
- ✅ Works well for values-driven companies

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Less structured than OKR
- ❌ The "Values" step can feel repetitive
- ❌ No built-in scoring mechanism
- ❌ Less common — fewer community resources

**Best for**: Companies that value culture-alignment alongside performance, or Salesforce ecosystem companies.

### 4DX — 4 Disciplines of Execution

**Origin**: FranklinCovey (Chris McChesney, Sean Covey, Jim Huling)

**Structure**:
```
Discipline 1: Focus on the Wildly Important Goal (WIG)
  "From X to Y by when"

Discipline 2: Act on Lead Measures
  Activity metrics that predict WIG success

Discipline 3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
  Visible, team-designed, shows lead and lag

Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability
  Weekly WIG sessions (20-30 min)
```

**Rules**:
- Max 2 WIGs per team at any time
- WIG has the form: "From [current state] to [goal state] by [date]"
- Lead Measures: things the team can directly influence
- Scoreboard: visible to the team, updated by the team
- Weekly meeting: commitments, scorecard review, accountability

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Laser focus (only 1-2 goals)
- ✅ Lead-measure thinking is powerful
- ✅ Weekly cadence keeps momentum
- ✅ Great for operational teams

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Only 1-2 goals — not enough for strategic planning
- ❌ Less suited for cross-functional alignment
- ❌ Requires heavy facilitation initially
- ❌ Can feel restrictive for creative/product teams

**Best for**: Operational teams, manufacturing, support teams, or any group executing against a well-defined target.

### EOS Rocks

**Origin**: Gino Wickman, Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)

**Structure**:
```
Company Rocks (3-7 per quarter)
  └─ Department Rocks (3-5 per department)
       └─ Individual Rocks (3-7 per person)
```

**Rules**:
- Set for 90-day cycles
- Binary: done (✅) or not done (❌) — no partial credit
- Reviewed weekly in L10 (Level 10) meetings
- Must be specific and achievable in 90 days
- Cascaded from company to individual

**Strengths**:
- ✅ 90-day focus drives urgency
- ✅ Binary scoring removes ambiguity
- ✅ Weekly L10 meetings create accountability
- ✅ Simple enough for any team size

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Binary scoring misses nuance
- ❌ 90 days may be too short for strategic goals
- ❌ Tightly coupled to EOS operating system
- ❌ No stretch / ambition mechanism

**Best for**: Small to mid-size businesses running the EOS operating system, or any team that values simplicity and accountability.

### Goal Map

**Origin**: Strategic planning practice, commonly used in high-growth B2B companies for cross-functional alignment

**Structure** (Two Parts):

Part 1 — **Functional View** (single-page strategic alignment):
```
Function Columns: Corporate | Sales | Strategy & Ops | Marketing | CS | Services | Product | Technology | Finance | HR

Row 1: Purpose           — Why the function exists (one sentence)
Row 2: BIG Goals          — Aspirational, qualitative (2-3 year)
Row 3: Measurable Goals   — Specific targets for this year/quarter
Row 4: Key Questions      — Critical unknowns that must be answered
Row 5: Critical Success Factors — What must go right
Row 6: Critical Assumptions    — What we're taking as given
Row 7: Risks              — What could go wrong
Row 8: Mitigating Actions  — Proactive risk reduction
Row 9: Open Questions      — Unresolved items needing decisions
```

Part 2 — **Metrics Map** (operational KPI registry):
```
For each function:
  KPI Name | Defined By | Goal/Target | Implementation Date |
  Data Source | Measurement Frequency (Daily → Annually) |
  Comments | Next Steps
```

**Rules**:
- CEO/leadership team collaboratively fills the Functional View
- Each function head owns their column
- BIG Goals are aspirational and qualitative (vision statements)
- Measurable Goals are specific, quantifiable targets
- The Risks / Assumptions / Mitigations rows are critical — they surface alignment gaps before they become problems
- The Metrics Map links each measurable goal to specific, tracked KPIs
- KPIs have explicit measurement frequencies — not all metrics are weekly
- "Baseline" targets are acceptable for first-time KPIs (measure first, set targets next quarter)
- Updated annually (BIG Goals) and quarterly (Measurable Goals, Metrics Map)

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Aligns ALL functions on one page — extremely powerful for leadership alignment
- ✅ Combines vision (BIG Goals) with accountability (Measurable Goals)
- ✅ Surfaces risks and assumptions proactively — unique vs. most frameworks
- ✅ The Metrics Map forces operational rigour on KPIs (data source, frequency, next steps)
- ✅ Flexible — works as a strategic umbrella above OKR, 4DX, EOS, etc.
- ✅ Purpose statements create clarity and motivation per function

**Weaknesses**:
- ❌ Requires dedicated leadership workshop to populate effectively
- ❌ Can be overwhelming for very small teams (< 20 people)
- ❌ No built-in scoring mechanism — needs OKR or EOS layered on top
- ❌ Risk of becoming a "fill-the-spreadsheet" exercise if not actively reviewed
- ❌ The Metrics Map can grow unwieldy if not curated (risk of too many KPIs)

**Best for**: Multi-function organisations (50-5,000+) that need to align every department around a common strategic direction. Especially valuable when combined with OKR or EOS Rocks for quarterly execution.

## Hybrid Approaches

Many successful organisations combine frameworks:

### OKR + 4DX
- Use OKRs for strategic goals
- Use 4DX for operational execution
- **Example**: OKR sets the quarterly target; 4DX identifies the lead measures and weekly cadence

### OKR + SMART
- Use OKRs for team/company goals
- Use SMART for individual development goals
- **Example**: Team OKR for revenue growth; Individual SMART goal for completing a certification

### BSC + OKR
- Use BSC for annual strategic framework
- Use OKRs for quarterly execution within each BSC perspective
- **Example**: BSC "Customer Perspective" → Q1 OKR: Increase NPS from 35 to 45

### EOS Rocks + OKR KRs
- Use Rocks for the "what" (binary deliverable)
- Add OKR-style KRs for the "how much" (measurable progress)
- **Example**: Rock: "Launch new pricing page" + KR: "Increase pricing page conversion from 2% to 5%"

### Goal Map + OKR
- Use the Goal Map as the **strategic umbrella** (annual)
- Cascade Measurable Goals into quarterly OKRs per function
- The Metrics Map becomes the source of truth for KPI definitions
- **Example**: Goal Map sets "Grow existing base revenue 10% YoY" → Q1 OKR: "Increase NRR from 95% to 105%" + KR: "Launch 3 upsell campaigns to top-50 accounts"

### Goal Map + EOS Rocks
- Use the Goal Map for annual strategic alignment
- Translate Measurable Goals into 90-day Rocks
- The Metrics Map feeds the weekly L10 scorecard
- **Example**: Goal Map: "Achieve 99.9% uptime SLA" → Q1 Rock: "Migrate to redundant infrastructure" + L10 Scorecard: Track weekly uptime %
