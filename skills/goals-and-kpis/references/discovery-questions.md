# Discovery & Qualification Framework

This guide helps you understand a user's context, challenges, and constraints **before** prescribing goal-setting frameworks or KPIs. A consultative approach builds trust and ensures recommendations fit the organization's reality.

---

## Why Discovery Matters

**Anti-pattern**: Jumping straight to "Here are your OKRs" without understanding:
- Current goal-setting maturity
- Team culture and buy-in
- Existing processes and tools
- Available time and resources
- Leadership support and commitment

**Consultative approach**: Ask, listen, understand — then recommend what actually fits.

---

## Discovery Question Framework

### 1. Organization Context (5-7 questions)

**Purpose**: Understand size, stage, structure, and business model

Essential questions:
- What's your company size? (Number of people, revenue/ARR, funding stage)
- What industry/sector are you in?
- What's your business model? (B2B SaaS, B2C, marketplace, services, etc.)
- How is your team structured? (Functions, departments, reporting lines)
- How distributed is your team? (Remote, hybrid, in-office)

**Why this matters**: A 10-person startup needs a different approach than a 500-person enterprise. SaaS companies often use OKRs; professional services firms often prefer different frameworks.

---

### 2. Current Goal-Setting State (6-8 questions)

**Purpose**: Assess maturity and identify what's working/broken

Essential questions:
- Do you currently have a goal-setting process? (Yes/No/Sort of)
- If yes, what framework do you use? (OKRs, KPIs, SMART goals, informal, etc.)
- How often do you set goals? (Annual, quarterly, monthly, never)
- Do you track progress? How? (Spreadsheet, tool, meetings, not really)
- What's working well with your current approach?
- What's frustrating or not working?
- Do teams/individuals have their own goals? Are they aligned to company goals?
- When did you last review or update your goals?

**Why this matters**:
- If they have nothing → start simple (Small Company Quick Start)
- If they have something broken → diagnose root cause first
- If they have something working → enhance, don't replace

**Common patterns to identify**:
- **"Set and forget"** → Need review cadence, not new framework
- **"Too many goals"** → Need prioritization, not more KPIs
- **"Nobody cares"** → Need leadership buy-in and accountability
- **"Don't know if we're winning"** → Need dashboards and metrics
- **"Goals feel made-up"** → Need connection to strategy

---

### 3. Strategic Context & Priorities (4-6 questions)

**Purpose**: Understand what the company is trying to achieve and why

Essential questions:
- What are your top 2-3 strategic priorities for the next 12 months?
- What's driving the need for goals/KPIs right now? (Scaling pain, investor requirement, new leadership, lack of alignment, etc.)
- Do you have a clear company vision/mission statement?
- What does success look like 12 months from now?
- What are the biggest risks or obstacles to achieving that success?

**Why this matters**: Goals must connect to strategy. If there's no strategy, you need to establish that first (or start with simple goals that can evolve).

**Red flags**:
- No clear priorities → High risk of "too many goals"
- External pressure (board, investors) → May need visible tracking/reporting
- Reactive ("we're failing so need goals") → Need diagnosis before prescription

---

### 4. Team Culture & Readiness (5-7 questions)

**Purpose**: Assess cultural fit and resistance risks

Essential questions:
- How do decisions typically get made? (Top-down, collaborative, consensus-driven)
- How do people feel about measurement and accountability? (Love it, neutral, resistant)
- Do managers regularly have 1-on-1s with their teams?
- How transparent is leadership with the team? (Very open, somewhat, closed-door)
- Have you tried implementing OKRs or similar frameworks before? What happened?
- How much time can leadership commit to goal-setting and reviews? (Hours/week)

**Why this matters**:
- Top-down cultures → OKRs with strong cascade work well
- Consensus cultures → Need more workshops and co-creation
- Resistant to measurement → Start light, build trust
- No 1-on-1 culture → Won't stick without establishing that first
- Previous failed attempts → Must understand why it failed

**Cultural fit guide**:
- **High-growth tech, ambitious, data-driven** → OKRs (stretch goals)
- **Traditional, risk-averse, stable** → SMART goals (achievable targets)
- **Entrepreneurial, fast-moving, SMB** → EOS Rocks (90-day focus)
- **Salesforce-inspired culture** → V2MOM
- **Operational teams, daily cadence** → 4DX

---

### 5. Constraints & Resources (4-6 questions)

**Purpose**: Understand what's realistic given time, budget, and skills

Essential questions:
- What's your timeline? (Need goals by when?)
- Do you have a budget for goal-setting tools? (None, <$1k, <$10k, enterprise)
- Who will own the goal-setting process? (You, leadership team, ops/strategy person)
- How much time can you invest in setup? (A few hours, a few days, ongoing)
- What tools do you currently use? (Notion, Asana, spreadsheets, Lattice, etc.)
- Do you have access to data/analytics for tracking KPIs?

**Why this matters**:
- **No time** → Use Small Company Quick Start (30-min setup)
- **No budget** → Google Sheets + Notion templates
- **No owner** → High failure risk; must establish ownership first
- **No data** → Start with manual tracking or proxy metrics
- **Complex enterprise tools** → May need integration planning

**Resource-based recommendations**:
- **0-2 hours/week available** → Minimal framework (3 company OKRs, monthly review)
- **2-5 hours/week available** → Standard OKRs with weekly check-ins
- **5+ hours/week available** → Full Goal Map + Metrics Map + dashboards

---

### 6. Functional Scope (3-4 questions)

**Purpose**: Determine which teams/functions need goals

Essential questions:
- Are we setting goals for the whole company, or specific teams/functions?
- Which functions exist in your organization? (Sales, Marketing, Product, Engineering, CS, Finance, HR, Ops)
- Do all functions need separate KPIs, or shared company metrics?
- Are there any functions that are struggling or need special attention?

**Why this matters**:
- Start small (company-level only) or go broad (cascade to all functions)?
- Identify cross-functional dependencies early
- Prioritize functions that are most critical or most broken

---

### 7. Success Criteria (2-3 questions)

**Purpose**: Understand what "good" looks like for this implementation

Essential questions:
- How will you know this goal-setting system is working?
- What would make this a success 3 months from now?
- What failure modes are you most worried about? (Nobody uses it, too complex, goals ignored, etc.)

**Why this matters**: Their success criteria tells you what to optimize for.

**Common success criteria and what they mean**:
- "Everyone knows what to work on" → Need clarity and cascading
- "We hit our targets" → Need realistic target-setting and leading indicators
- "Leadership is aligned" → Need strategic Goal Map
- "We stop wasting time on the wrong things" → Need prioritization framework
- "People feel motivated" → Need inspiring objectives, not just metrics

---

## Discovery Question Workflow

### Phase 1: Quick Context (2-3 minutes)
Ask the essentials to understand scope:
1. Company size and stage
2. Current goal-setting state (have something / have nothing / have something broken)
3. Primary objective (Why now? What's the pain?)

### Phase 2: Deep Dive (5-10 minutes)
Based on Phase 1, dive deeper:
- **If starting from scratch** → Focus on culture, resources, and timeline
- **If fixing broken system** → Focus on diagnosing what went wrong
- **If scaling/enhancing** → Focus on maturity, tools, and cascade depth

### Phase 3: Constraints & Fit (3-5 minutes)
- Resources available (time, budget, ownership)
- Timeline and urgency
- Cultural readiness

### Phase 4: Success Definition (2 minutes)
- What does success look like?
- What are you most worried about?

**Total discovery time: 15-20 minutes**

## After Discovery: Synthesis & Recommendation

Once you have answers, synthesize findings and provide a recommendation that addresses:

### 1. Framework Selection
Based on culture, size, and maturity:
- **Recommend one primary framework** (OKR, SMART, EOS Rocks, Goal Map)
- **Explain why this fits** their context
- **Mention alternatives** if they have special constraints

### 2. Scope & Depth
- Start at company level only? Or cascade to departments?
- 3 objectives or 5? How many key results per objective?
- Weekly check-ins or monthly?

### 3. Implementation Plan
- **Week 1-2**: Set up framework, draft first goals
- **Week 3-4**: Roll out to teams, establish review cadence
- **Month 2**: First retrospective and refinement
- **Month 3**: Scale or enhance

### 4. Tools & Templates
- What tool to use (based on budget and existing tools)
- Which templates to start with
- Dashboard or not (based on data availability)

### 5. Risk Mitigation
Address their stated concerns:
- "Worried nobody will use it" → Establish weekly review cadence and executive sponsorship
- "Worried it's too complex" → Start with Small Company Quick Start
- "Worried we'll set wrong goals" → Use anti-patterns guide, iterate quarterly

## Red Flags to Watch For

These signals suggest high risk of failure — address them before prescribing a framework:

🚩 **"We tried OKRs before and they didn't stick"**
- Ask: "What went wrong? Why didn't it stick?"
- Common causes: No leadership buy-in, no review cadence, too complex, wrong cultural fit
- Solution: Address root cause first (don't just try OKRs again)

🚩 **"Leadership doesn't have time for weekly check-ins"**
- Risk: Goals will be ignored
- Solution: Start with monthly reviews, or don't implement yet

🚩 **"We have 15 strategic priorities"**
- Risk: No focus, everything is a priority
- Solution: Prioritization exercise first (force rank, impact/effort, strategic bets)

🚩 **"We don't have any data or analytics"**
- Risk: Can't track KPIs objectively
- Solution: Start with qualitative goals, or set up basic tracking first

🚩 **"Nobody here likes being measured"**
- Risk: Cultural resistance will kill adoption
- Solution: Start with team-level goals (not individual), focus on learning not judgment

🚩 **"We need goals by next Monday"**
- Risk: Rushed goals are bad goals
- Solution: Set 3 simple goals quickly, plan to refine them over the quarter

## Example Discovery Conversation

**User**: "I want to set up OKRs for my 30-person B2B SaaS startup"

**❌ Bad (Prescriptive) Response**:
"Great! Here are your Q1 2026 OKRs:
- Objective 1: Accelerate ARR Growth
  - KR1: Increase ARR from $2M to $3M
  - KR2: Close 15 new logos..."

**✅ Good (Consultative) Response**:
"I'd love to help you set up OKRs. Before I recommend a specific approach, let me understand your context:

1. **Current state**: Do you have any goal-setting process today, or are you starting from scratch?
2. **Team structure**: How is your 30-person team organized? (Sales, Marketing, Product, Eng, CS?)
3. **Why now**: What's prompting you to implement OKRs at this point?
4. **Culture**: How do decisions typically get made? More top-down or collaborative?
5. **Resources**: How much time can you and your leadership team dedicate to this each week?

Once I understand your situation, I can recommend whether to start with simple company-level OKRs, cascade to departments, or even consider a different framework if that's a better fit for your team culture."

**Why the second approach is better**:
- Shows you're listening, not just prescribing
- Uncovers constraints and risks early
- Builds trust by demonstrating expertise through questions
- Ensures recommendation actually fits their reality
- Reduces risk of wasted work

## Summary: Discovery-First Mindset

**Remember**:
- Every organization is different
- What works for Google may not work for a 10-person agency
- Failed goal systems are usually a culture/process problem, not a framework problem
- 15 minutes of discovery saves hours of rework
- The best framework is the one they'll actually use

**Discovery is not overhead — it's the most valuable part of the consulting process.**
