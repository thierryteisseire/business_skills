# Small Company Quick Start Guide (5-50 People)

If you're running a startup or small business, traditional goal-setting frameworks can feel like overkill. This guide gives you the **minimum viable goal system** that actually works for small teams.

---

## TL;DR — Start Here (30-Minute Setup)

### For Companies with 5-20 People

**Use: Simple OKRs (No Cascading)**

```
Company OKRs (3 max) → Everyone knows them → Weekly 15-min check-in → Done.
```

**Example:**
```
Q2 2026 Company OKRs

Objective 1: Achieve product-market fit
  KR1: Get to 50 paying customers (currently: 12)
  KR2: Achieve 40+ NPS (currently: 28)
  KR3: 80% of customers use core feature 3x/week

Objective 2: Build repeatable sales motion
  KR1: Close 10 deals with same pitch deck
  KR2: Demo-to-close rate > 25%
  KR3: Sales cycle < 30 days average

Objective 3: Extend runway to 18 months
  KR1: Reduce burn to $40K/month (currently: $65K)
  KR2: Generate $15K MRR (currently: $8K)
```

**What You Track (Weekly Dashboard):**
- Revenue / MRR
- Active customers
- Cash runway (months)
- 1-2 metrics per OKR

**Meeting Cadence:**
- Monday morning: 15-min all-hands OKR check-in
- End of quarter: 1-hour retrospective + next quarter planning

---

### For Companies with 20-50 People

**Use: OKRs with 2-Level Cascade**

```
Company OKRs → Department/Team OKRs → Weekly check-ins
```

**Departments at this stage:**
- Product/Engineering
- Sales/Marketing (often combined)
- Customer Success (if B2B SaaS)

**Example Cascade:**

```
Company OKR: Grow ARR from $500K to $1.5M

↓

Sales/Marketing Team OKRs:
  O: Build predictable pipeline engine
    KR1: Generate 50 SQLs per month
    KR2: Win rate > 20%
    KR3: Pipeline coverage 4x

↓

Product/Engineering Team OKRs:
  O: Reduce churn through product quality
    KR1: Decrease churn from 8% to 4%
    KR2: Increase feature adoption 30% → 50%
    KR3: Zero critical bugs for 90 days
```

## Why Small Companies Fail at Goals

| Failure Mode | Why It Happens | Fix |
|--------------|----------------|-----|
| **Too many goals** | Trying to copy Google | Max 3 company OKRs, period |
| **Goals change weekly** | Reacting to every fire | Commit for the quarter, no changes |
| **No one remembers them** | No review cadence | 15-min Monday check-in, non-negotiable |
| **Goals feel fake** | Disconnected from daily work | Every task should map to a KR |
| **Sandbagging** | Fear of missing goals | Make them stretch goals (70% = success) |
| **Vanity metrics** | Measuring activity not impact | Only metrics you'd trade money for |

---

## Framework Decision Tree for Small Companies

```
START: How many people?

5-10 people
  ├─ Are you pre-product-market fit?
  │   └─ YES → Use 4DX (1-2 WIGs max) + Weekly scoreboard
  │   └─ NO → Use Simple OKRs (3 company OKRs, no cascade)
  │
  └─ Do you have departments yet?
      └─ NO → Simple OKRs

10-20 people
  ├─ Do you have a formal management layer?
  │   └─ NO → Simple OKRs + Monthly reviews
  │   └─ YES → OKRs with 2-level cascade
  │
  └─ Running EOS already?
      └─ YES → EOS Rocks (3-7 per 90 days)

20-50 people
  ├─ Multiple departments (Eng, Sales, CS)?
  │   └─ YES → OKRs with 2-level cascade + Department dashboards
  │
  └─ Need board-level reporting?
      └─ YES → Add Goal Map (annual) + Quarterly OKRs
```

## KPIs for Small Companies (Keep It Simple)

### Stage 1: Pre-Product-Market Fit (5-15 people)

**Track Only These:**

| Metric | Why | How to Measure |
|--------|-----|----------------|
| **Active users (or customers)** | Are people using it? | Your database |
| **Usage frequency** | Are they coming back? | Analytics tool (Mixpanel, Amplitude) |
| **NPS or CSAT** | Do they love it? | Quarterly survey (use Delighted) |
| **Runway (months)** | Will we survive? | Bank balance / monthly burn |
| **Revenue or MRR** | Can we pay the bills? | Your billing system |

**Don't track:** CAC, LTV, churn cohorts, sales velocity — too early.

---

### Stage 2: Post-PMF, Scaling (15-50 people)

**Add These:**

| Department | Core KPIs (3-5 max) |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Sales** | Pipeline, Win Rate, Revenue Closed, Quota Attainment |
| **Marketing** | MQLs, Cost per Lead, MQL→SQL Conversion |
| **Product** | Feature Adoption, DAU/MAU, Time to Value |
| **Customer Success** | NRR, Churn Rate, NPS |
| **Finance** | Revenue, Burn Rate, Runway, Gross Margin |

**Meeting Cadence:**
- Weekly: Team-level OKR check-ins (30 min)
- Monthly: Department reviews with leadership (60 min)
- Quarterly: All-hands planning session (half-day)

---

## Tools for Small Companies (Budget-Friendly)

| Need | Free/Cheap Option | Cost |
|------|-------------------|------|
| **OKR Tracking** | Google Sheets, Notion, Asana | $0-$10/user |
| **Dashboards** | Google Sheets + Data Studio | Free |
| **Analytics** | Mixpanel (free tier), Amplitude (free tier) | $0-$200/mo |
| **Surveys (NPS)** | Google Forms, Typeform (free), Delighted ($100/mo) | $0-$100/mo |
| **CRM** | HubSpot (free), Airtable | $0-$50/user |

**Anti-Recommendation:** Don't buy Salesforce, Tableau, or enterprise OKR tools until you're 50+ people and generating >$5M ARR.

## Common Mistakes Small Companies Make

### Mistake 1: Copying Google's OKR System

**Problem:** Google has 100,000 employees. You have 15.

**Fix:** Use a simplified version:
- No individual OKRs (just company + department)
- No complex scoring systems
- No fancy OKR software

---

### Mistake 2: Setting Too Many Goals

**Problem:** "We need to grow revenue AND build product AND hire AND improve culture AND..."

**Fix:** Ruthlessly prioritize. If everything is a priority, nothing is.

**Rule:** Max 3 company OKRs. If you can only do ONE thing this quarter, what moves the needle most?

---

### Mistake 3: Goals That Don't Drive Behavior

**Problem:** OKR says "Increase NPS to 50" but no one changes what they do.

**Fix:** For each KR, ask: "What will we do DIFFERENTLY to achieve this?"

**Example:**
- ❌ Bad KR: Increase NPS to 50
- ✅ Good KR: Increase NPS to 50 by implementing in-app onboarding + monthly customer interviews

---

### Mistake 4: No Weekly Rhythm

**Problem:** Set goals in January, forgot by February.

**Fix:** 15-minute Monday morning check-in, no exceptions.

**Format:**
- Each owner: % progress, confidence (🟢🟡🔴), top priority this week
- Identify blockers
- Done

---

### Mistake 5: Sandbag Targets

**Problem:** Setting goals you know you'll hit because you're scared to fail.

**Fix:** OKRs should be stretch goals. 70% achievement = success.

**Example:**
- If you're confident you'll hit 30 customers, set the target at 45
- If you think you can close $500K, aim for $700K

## Graduation Path: When to Add Complexity

| Company Stage | System | Meeting Cadence |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| **5-10 people** | Simple OKRs (company-level only) | Weekly 15-min check-in |
| **10-20 people** | OKRs + monthly reviews | Weekly check-ins + monthly review |
| **20-50 people** | OKRs with 2-level cascade | Weekly (teams) + monthly (leadership) |
| **50-100 people** | OKRs + Goal Map (annual) | Weekly + monthly + quarterly |
| **100-250 people** | OKRs + Goal Map + Department dashboards | Full cadence (weekly → annual) |
| **250+ people** | Consider BSC or formal V2MOM | Enterprise review structure |

**Within 30 Days:**
- [ ] Complete 4 weekly check-ins
- [ ] Adjust targets if wildly off (rare, but okay in first quarter)
- [ ] Document what's working and what's not

**End of Quarter:**
- [ ] Score each OKR (0.0-1.0)
- [ ] Run retrospective (1 hour)
- [ ] Set next quarter OKRs (use learnings)

## Final Advice for Small Company Leaders

1. **Start simple.** You can always add complexity later.
2. **Consistency > perfection.** Better to track 3 metrics weekly than 30 metrics never.
3. **Make it public.** Everyone should see the OKRs and dashboard.
4. **Celebrate progress.** 0.7 on a stretch goal is a win, not a failure.
5. **Kill bad goals fast.** If a goal becomes irrelevant mid-quarter, drop it. Don't be precious.

The best goal system is the one you'll actually use. Start with the minimum viable version and evolve as you grow.
