## The 10 Most Common OKR Mistakes

---

## 1. Vague, Unmeasurable Objectives

### ❌ BAD

**Objective: Improve our product**

**Why it fails:**
- "Improve" is meaningless — improve how?
- Not inspiring or specific
- Could mean 100 different things

### ✅ GOOD

**Objective: Make our product the easiest to onboard in the category**

**KR1:** Reduce time-to-first-value from 7 days to 2 days
**KR2:** Achieve 80% activation rate within first week (currently 45%)
**KR3:** Onboarding NPS >60 (currently 32)

**Why it works:**
- Specific outcome: "easiest to onboard"
- Inspiring: beat the category
- KRs make it measurable

---

## 2. Activities Disguised as Key Results

### ❌ BAD

**Objective: Build a great sales team**

**KR1:** Hire 5 sales reps
**KR2:** Complete sales training program
**KR3:** Create sales playbook

**Why it fails:**
- All KRs are activities (hire, complete, create)
- No measurement of outcomes
- Could do all three and still fail at objective

### ✅ GOOD

**Objective: Build a high-performing, repeatable sales motion**

**KR1:** New sales team closes $500K ARR (team didn't exist before)
**KR2:** Rep ramp time <60 days to first deal
**KR3:** Win rate >25% across all 5 new hires

**Why it works:**
- Measures outcomes (ARR, time, win rate)
- Activities become initiatives (how you'll hit the KRs)
- Could fail at hiring and still hit KRs (via other methods)

---

## 3. Too Many Objectives

### ❌ BAD

**Company OKRs (10 objectives, 30 KRs)**

1. Grow revenue
2. Improve product
3. Build brand
4. Increase retention
5. Improve culture
6. Optimize operations
7. Expand internationally
8. Strengthen partnerships
9. Improve security
10. Hire great people

**Why it fails:**
- No focus — everything is a priority
- Team doesn't know what matters most
- Impossible to achieve 10 things in one quarter

### ✅ GOOD

**Company OKRs (3 objectives, 9 KRs)**

1. **Cross $5M ARR with strong unit economics**
   - KR1: Net new ARR $2M
   - KR2: NRR 115%
   - KR3: CAC payback <12 months

2. **Prove product scales to mid-market**
   - KR1: Close 5 deals >$100K ACV
   - KR2: Launch enterprise features (SSO, RBAC)
   - KR3: Achieve SOC 2 certification

3. **Build a category-leading brand**
   - KR1: 50,000 newsletter subscribers
   - KR2: Featured in 10 industry publications
   - KR3: Organic traffic 100K/month

**Why it works:**
- Ruthless prioritization
- Each objective is clearly different
- Could articulate all 3 in 30 seconds

---

## 4. Sandbagging (Targets Too Easy)

### ❌ BAD

**Objective: Grow our customer base**

**KR1:** Add 10 new customers (we added 12 last quarter with no effort)
**KR2:** Achieve $50K MRR (we're at $48K and growing 10%/month naturally)
**KR3:** Maintain churn <10% (it's been 3% for 6 months)

**Why it fails:**
- Will hit all KRs by doing nothing
- No ambition or stretch
- Team won't be motivated

### ✅ GOOD

**Objective: Prove we can scale customer acquisition 3x**

**KR1:** Add 40 new customers (last quarter: 12)
**KR2:** Achieve $80K MRR (currently $48K = 67% growth)
**KR3:** Churn <5% while growing 3x faster (currently 3%)

**Why it works:**
- Requires real effort and innovation
- 40 customers is a stretch from 12
- The churn KR gets harder as you scale faster

**OKR Philosophy:** Hitting 1.0 on all KRs means they weren't ambitious enough. Target 0.7-0.8.

---

## 5. No Connection Between Objective and Key Results

### ❌ BAD

**Objective: Become the market leader in our space**

**KR1:** Hire 3 engineers
**KR2:** Launch mobile app
**KR3:** Achieve 99.9% uptime

**Why it fails:**
- KRs don't prove market leadership
- Could hit all 3 and still have 100 customers
- Disconnected from the big goal

### ✅ GOOD

**Objective: Become the market leader in our space**

**KR1:** Achieve 30% market share by logo count (currently 8%)
**KR2:** Win "Best Product" award from [Industry Association]
**KR3:** 50% of RFPs include us in the shortlist (currently 15%)

**Why it works:**
- Each KR directly proves market leadership
- If you hit all 3, the objective is clearly achieved
- Activities (hire engineers, launch mobile) are how you'll get there

---

## 6. Lagging-Only KRs (No Leading Indicators)

### ❌ BAD

**Objective: Hit our revenue target**

**KR1:** Close $1M in revenue this quarter
**KR2:** Win rate >25%
**KR3:** Average deal size $50K

**Why it fails:**
- All lagging — you only know if you hit them at quarter-end
- Can't course-correct mid-quarter
- No actionable metrics to drive weekly

### ✅ GOOD (Option 1: Add Leading Indicators)

**Objective: Hit our revenue target through pipeline discipline**

**KR1:** Close $1M in revenue this quarter *(lagging)*
**KR2:** Generate $4M in qualified pipeline *(leading)*
**KR3:** Conduct 60 discovery calls *(leading)*

**Or ✅ GOOD (Option 2: Track as Initiatives)**

**Objective: Close $1M in revenue this quarter**

**KR1:** Revenue closed $1M
**KR2:** Win rate 25%
**KR3:** Average deal size $50K

**Initiatives (tracked weekly):**
- Generate $4M in pipeline (1.0 → 4.0 by week 12)
- Conduct 60 discovery calls (5 per week)
- Send 30 proposals (2.5 per week)

**Why it works:**
- OKRs measure outcome
- Initiatives give you weekly actions to drive
- Can see if you're on track by week 4, not week 12

---

## 7. Unmeasurable or Subjective KRs

### ❌ BAD

**Objective: Deliver an amazing customer experience**

**KR1:** Improve customer satisfaction
**KR2:** Reduce support burden
**KR3:** Make customers happier

**Why it fails:**
- "Improve" by how much?
- "Reduce burden" — measured how?
- "Happier" is not quantified

### ✅ GOOD

**Objective: Deliver an exceptional customer experience**

**KR1:** Achieve CSAT score >4.5/5 (currently 3.8)
**KR2:** Reduce average ticket resolution time from 36 hours to 12 hours
**KR3:** Increase NPS from 28 to 50

**Why it works:**
- Every KR has a number
- Clear starting point and target
- Unambiguous scoring at end of quarter

---

## 8. Copying Last Quarter's Goals (No Evolution)

### ❌ BAD

**Q1 2026:**
**Objective: Grow revenue**
- KR1: Close $500K
- KR2: Win rate >20%

**Q2 2026:**
**Objective: Grow revenue**
- KR1: Close $600K
- KR2: Win rate >20%

**Q3 2026:**
**Objective: Grow revenue**
- KR1: Close $700K
- KR2: Win rate >20%

**Why it fails:**
- No learning or evolution
- Ignores changing context (market, team, product)
- Becomes rote exercise

### ✅ GOOD (Evolution Over Time)

**Q1 2026:**
**Objective: Prove the sales motion works**
- KR1: Close $500K with repeatable playbook
- KR2: Win rate >20%
- KR3: Sales cycle <45 days

**Q2 2026:**
**Objective: Scale the sales motion with new hires**
- KR1: Close $800K (3 new reps contributing)
- KR2: New reps hit quota in <60 days
- KR3: Maintain win rate >20% as team scales

**Q3 2026:**
**Objective: Move upmarket while maintaining velocity**
- KR1: Close $1.2M (40% from deals >$100K)
- KR2: Enterprise win rate >15%
- KR3: Mid-market win rate >30%

**Why it works:**
- Each quarter builds on last quarter's learnings
- Objectives reflect the company's evolution
- Focus shifts as capabilities mature

## 9. Individual OKRs That Don't Ladder Up

### ❌ BAD

**Company OKR:**
Objective: Achieve $2M ARR

**Sales Rep Individual OKR:**
Objective: Become a better salesperson
- KR1: Complete sales training
- KR2: Get certified in [Tool]
- KR3: Shadow 10 sales calls

**Why it fails:**
- Individual OKR has zero connection to company goal
- Personal development ≠ business impact
- Could hit all KRs and company still fails

### ✅ GOOD

**Company OKR:**
Objective: Achieve $2M ARR

**Sales Team OKR:**
Objective: Drive net new ARR growth
- KR1: Close $800K net new ARR
- KR2: Win rate >25%
- KR3: Pipeline coverage 4x

**Sales Rep Individual OKR:**
Objective: Contribute 20% of team's new ARR target
- KR1: Close $160K in new ARR (my share of team goal)
- KR2: Achieve personal win rate >25%
- KR3: Generate $640K in qualified pipeline

**Initiatives (Personal Development):**
- Complete sales training by Week 4
- Get certified in [Tool]
- Shadow 10 sales calls with top performer

**Why it works:**
- Individual OKR directly contributes to company goal
- Clear math: $160K × 5 reps = $800K team goal
- Personal development becomes initiatives, not KRs

---

## 10. Business-As-Usual Disguised as OKRs

### ❌ BAD

**Objective: Keep the business running**

**KR1:** Respond to all support tickets within 24 hours
**KR2:** Deploy code every week
**KR3:** Hit weekly sales targets

**Why it fails:**
- These are operational metrics, not goals
- You should be doing these anyway
- No ambition or step-change

### ✅ GOOD

**Separate OKRs from BAU:**

**OKRs (Ambitious, Quarterly):**
Objective: Transform support from reactive to proactive
- KR1: Reduce ticket volume 40% through in-app guidance
- KR2: Deflect 60% of tickets with AI-powered help center
- KR3: Support CSAT >4.7 (currently 3.9)

**BAU Metrics (Track Weekly, No OKR Needed):**
- Ticket response time <2 hours
- Ticket resolution time <24 hours
- Weekly code deploys
- Weekly sales pipeline generation

**Why it works:**
- OKRs drive transformation
- BAU metrics ensure operational excellence
- Clear separation prevents confusion

### ✅ GOOD (Best Practices Applied)

**Q2 2026 Company OKRs**

**Objective 1: Achieve product-market fit with mid-market customers**
*Why: We've proven SMB, now we need to prove we can serve larger customers*

- **KR1:** Close 10 deals with >100 employees (currently 0)
- **KR2:** Achieve 80% 90-day retention in mid-market segment (currently 45%)
- **KR3:** NPS >50 from mid-market customers (currently no data)

**Objective 2: Build a predictable pipeline engine**
*Why: We're closing deals opportunistically; we need repeatability*

- **KR1:** Generate $2M in qualified pipeline (4x coverage)
- **KR2:** MQL→SQL conversion 25% (currently 12%)
- **KR3:** 50% of pipeline from repeatable channels (inbound, referrals) vs. outbound

**Objective 3: Become operationally efficient at current scale**
*Why: Burn is too high; need to prove unit economics before raising next round*

- **KR1:** Reduce burn from $200K to $140K per month
- **KR2:** CAC payback <12 months (currently 18 months)
- **KR3:** Gross margin >75% (currently 68%)

**Why it works:**
- Only 3 objectives (focused)
- Each objective is qualitative and inspiring
- Every KR is measurable (number + current state)
- Mix of leading and lagging indicators
- Ambitious but achievable (would score 0.7-0.8)
- Clear connection: if we hit these, we've achieved the objectives

## Quick Reference: Words to Avoid vs. Use

### ✅ Use These Specific Words

## When to Break the Rules

Sometimes "bad" OKRs are okay:

1. **First quarter using OKRs:** Keep it simple, even if not perfect. Better to start than to overthink.

2. **Crisis mode:** If you're running out of cash, "Extend runway to 12 months" is fine even though it's not inspiring.

3. **Very small companies (5-10 people):** Simple OKRs like "Get to 50 customers" are perfectly fine.

4. **Operational teams:** Some teams (support, finance, IT) may have more BAU-flavored OKRs, which is okay.

**Golden rule:** Better to have simple OKRs you execute than perfect OKRs you ignore.
