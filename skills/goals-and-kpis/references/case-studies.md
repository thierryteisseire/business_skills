# Goal-Setting Case Studies — Real-World Examples

Three anonymized case studies showing how companies implemented goal-setting frameworks, what worked, what didn't, and key learnings.

---

## Case Study 1: From Chaos to Clarity
### 18-Person SaaS Startup Implements OKRs

**Company:** B2B marketing automation SaaS
**Stage:** Post-seed, pre-PMF
**Team:** 18 people (6 eng, 4 sales, 3 marketing, 2 CS, 3 ops/admin)
**Before State:** No formal goals, reactive mode, frequent pivots

---

### The Problem

**January 2025:**
- CEO had goals in his head, team didn't know them
- Every Monday's priorities were different from last Monday
- Team felt like they were "building a plane while flying it"
- No clear success metrics — celebrating vanity wins
- High stress, low morale

**Symptom:** Engineer quote: *"I don't know if what I'm building matters. We launched 3 features last quarter and I have no idea if anyone uses them."*

---

### What They Did

**Month 1: Foundation (February 2025)**

1. **CEO wrote draft company OKRs** (took 3 attempts)
   - First draft: 6 objectives, 22 KRs (too many)
   - Second draft: 4 objectives, still too complex
   - Final: 3 objectives, 9 KRs

2. **Held all-hands goal-setting session** (3 hours, Friday afternoon)
   - CEO presented draft OKRs
   - Open discussion: What's missing? What's unrealistic?
   - Team voted on top priorities (dot voting)
   - Refined and finalized

3. **Set up simple tracking** (Google Sheet)
   - One tab per objective
   - Updated weekly by KR owners
   - Visible to everyone

**Final Q1 2025 OKRs:**

**Objective 1: Prove people will pay for this**
- KR1: Get to 25 paying customers (from 4)
- KR2: Achieve 30-day retention >70%
- KR3: MRR $15K (from $2.4K)

**Objective 2: Build a sales motion we can repeat**
- KR1: Close 8 deals using same pitch deck
- KR2: Demo-to-close rate >25%
- KR3: Document full sales playbook

**Objective 3: Extend runway to 18 months**
- KR1: Reduce burn to $120K/month (from $180K)
- KR2: 3-month cash forecast accuracy >90%

**Meeting Cadence:**
- Monday 9am: 15-min all-hands OKR check-in
- Friday 4pm: Department stand-ups (optional deep-dives)

---

### What Happened

**Month 1 (February):**
- ✅ **Week 1-2:** Team loved the clarity. Morale boost.
- ⚠️ **Week 3:** Realized KR1 (25 customers) was way too ambitious
- ❌ **Week 4:** Monday check-in got skipped (CEO traveling)

**Month 2 (March):**
- ✅ Consistently hit Monday check-ins
- ✅ Engineering reprioritized roadmap around retention (KR2)
- ❌ Sales struggled — only 2 deals closed (vs. 8 target)
- ⚠️ Discovered their "paying customer" definition was broken (included trials)

**Month 3 (April):**
- ✅ Product changes drove retention from 45% to 68%
- ✅ Burn reduced to $135K/month (not $120K, but progress)
- ❌ Only reached 14 customers (vs. 25 target)
- ✅ Documented sales playbook (KR3)

**End of Q1 Score:**

| Objective | KR | Target | Actual | Score |
|-----------|----|-|--------|-------|
| **1: Prove PMF** | Customers | 25 | 14 | 0.56 |
| | Retention | 70% | 68% | 0.97 |
| | MRR | $15K | $9.8K | 0.65 |
| **2: Sales motion** | Deals closed | 8 | 5 | 0.63 |
| | Demo-to-close | 25% | 22% | 0.88 |
| | Playbook | Done | Done | 1.0 |
| **3: Extend runway** | Burn reduction | $120K | $135K | 0.75 |
| | Forecast accuracy | 90% | 78% | 0.87 |
| **Overall Average** | | | | **0.76** |

---

### Retrospective: What They Learned

**What Worked:**
1. ✅ **Clarity transformed morale** — Team finally knew what mattered
2. ✅ **Weekly check-ins created accountability** — "I don't want to show up with nothing"
3. ✅ **Cross-functional alignment** — Engineering prioritized retention because it was a company KR
4. ✅ **Scoring 0.76 felt like a win** — Ambitious goals are good

**What Didn't Work:**
1. ❌ **KR1 was too ambitious** — 25 customers from 4 in one quarter was unrealistic for their market
2. ❌ **Skipping one Monday check-in broke momentum** — Took 2 weeks to recover
3. ❌ **Definition issues** — "Paying customer" wasn't well-defined, caused confusion
4. ❌ **No leading indicators** — They tracked lagging KRs, couldn't course-correct mid-quarter

**Changes for Q2:**
1. Set more realistic targets based on Q1 learnings
2. Made Monday check-in sacred (CEO never skips)
3. Defined all metrics clearly upfront
4. Added weekly leading indicators (pipeline, demos held, feature usage)

---

### Q2 Results

With adjustments, Q2 went much better:
- Scored 0.82 average (vs. 0.76 in Q1)
- Hit 32 customers (target was 30)
- Retention reached 75%
- Team now "couldn't imagine" working without OKRs

**CEO Quote:** *"Q1 felt chaotic. Q2 felt focused. Everyone knows what we're trying to achieve and why. That's worth the effort alone."*

---

## Case Study 2: The Scaling Challenge
### 75-Person Company Struggles with Goal Cascade

**Company:** B2B SaaS (project management)
**Stage:** Series A, growing fast
**Team:** 75 people (30 eng, 15 sales, 12 CS, 10 marketing, 8 G&A)
**Before State:** Company OKRs existed but departments weren't aligned

---

### The Problem

**Q3 2024:**
- Company hit OKRs but departments felt disconnected
- Sales closed $2M ARR (hit target) but CS churn spiked (not tracked)
- Engineering shipped features no one wanted
- Marketing generated leads but they didn't convert
- Each department had their own goals, no cascading

**Symptom:** CFO quote: *"We hit our revenue number but almost went out of business because no one was watching churn. We're not aligned."*

---

### What They Did

**Hired an OKR consultant** (fractional, $5K/month for 6 months) to redesign their system.

**New Approach: 3-Level Cascade**

```
Company OKRs
  ↓
Department OKRs (Eng, Sales, CS, Marketing)
  ↓
Team OKRs (within each department)
```

**Q4 2024 Company OKRs:**

**Objective 1: Achieve $10M ARR with healthy unit economics**
- KR1: Grow ARR from $6M to $10M
- KR2: Net Revenue Retention >110%
- KR3: CAC payback <10 months

**Objective 2: Become the #1 product in our category**
- KR1: Achieve #1 ranking on G2 (currently #4)
- KR2: Win 5 competitive replacements from top competitor
- KR3: 80% feature parity with enterprise requirements

**Objective 3: Build a world-class team**
- KR1: Hire 20 people on-plan (5 eng, 8 sales, 4 CS, 3 marketing)
- KR2: Employee engagement score >4.2/5 (currently 3.7)
- KR3: Zero regretted attrition

**Then cascaded to departments:**

---

#### Sales Department OKRs

**Objective: Drive $4M net new ARR from mid-market and enterprise**
- KR1: Close $4M net new ARR (company needs this for $10M total)
- KR2: 50% of ARR from deals >$50K (move upmarket)
- KR3: Win rate >30% (up from 22%)

**How it connects:** Company KR1 ($10M ARR) = $4M new + $6M expansion/retention (from CS)

---

#### Customer Success Department OKRs

**Objective: Drive expansion and protect the base**
- KR1: Generate $2M in expansion ARR (upsell/cross-sell)
- KR2: Gross churn <3% (currently 7% — big problem!)
- KR3: NPS >55 (currently 38)

**How it connects:** Company KR1 ($10M ARR) = $4M new (Sales) + $6M net from base (CS must expand $2M + protect $4M)

---

#### Engineering Department OKRs

**Objective: Ship features that drive competitive wins**
- KR1: Deliver 8 enterprise features (SSO, RBAC, audit logs, API, etc.)
- KR2: 99.9% uptime (currently 99.5% — enterprise requirement)
- KR3: Zero P0/P1 bugs for 60 consecutive days

**How it connects:** Company Objective 2 (become #1 product) requires enterprise features + stability

---

#### Marketing Department OKRs

**Objective: Build a pipeline engine for mid-market/enterprise**
- KR1: Generate $16M in qualified pipeline (4x coverage for Sales)
- KR2: 50% of pipeline from mid-market/enterprise (vs. SMB)
- KR3: MQL→SQL conversion >25% (currently 12%)

**How it connects:** Sales can't close $4M without pipeline from Marketing

---

### Implementation Process

**Month 1 (October):**
1. CEO set company OKRs
2. Each department head drafted their OKRs
3. Cross-functional review session (4 hours):
   - Checked math: Do department KRs add up to company KRs?
   - Identified dependencies: Marketing must deliver pipeline for Sales
   - Resolved conflicts: Who owns expansion? (Answer: CS, not Sales)

**Meeting Cadence:**
- **Weekly:** Department-level OKR check-ins (30 min)
- **Bi-weekly:** Leadership team OKR review (60 min)
- **Monthly:** All-hands update (30 min, CEO presents progress)

**Dashboard:**
- Built in Notion with company + all department OKRs
- Color-coded: 🟢 Green (>70%), 🟡 Yellow (40-70%), 🔴 Red (<40%)
- Updated weekly

---

### What Happened

**October (Month 1):**
- ✅ Cascade process forced alignment conversations
- ⚠️ Discovered Sales and CS had overlapping goals (confusion on who owns expansion)
- ✅ Resolved: CS owns expansion, Sales focuses on net new

**November (Month 2):**
- ✅ Churn became a company-wide priority (CS OKR + everyone cared)
- ✅ Engineering reprioritized roadmap to support enterprise features
- ❌ Marketing struggled to generate mid-market pipeline (targeting SMB easier)

**December (Month 3):**
- ✅ Hit $9.2M ARR (vs. $10M target) — scored 0.92
- ✅ Churn dropped from 7% to 4% (huge win)
- ✅ Shipped 7/8 enterprise features
- ❌ Only won 3 competitive replacements (vs. 5 target)

**Q4 Final Score:**

| Level | Score | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Company OKRs | 0.78 | Strong, but missed G2 ranking goal |
| Sales OKRs | 0.85 | Exceeded ARR, slightly missed win rate |
| CS OKRs | 0.92 | Massive churn improvement |
| Engineering OKRs | 0.88 | Shipped most features, hit uptime |
| Marketing OKRs | 0.65 | Struggled with mid-market pipeline |

---

### Retrospective: What They Learned

**What Worked:**
1. ✅ **Cascade forced alignment** — Couldn't ignore dependencies anymore
2. ✅ **Cross-functional review surfaced conflicts early** — Resolved in Oct vs. discovering in Dec
3. ✅ **Churn became everyone's problem** — CS couldn't fix alone, needed Product + Support + Sales handoff improvements
4. ✅ **Bi-weekly leadership reviews kept exec team synced**

**What Didn't Work:**
1. ❌ **Cascade was complex to set up** — Took 3 weeks, consultant helped
2. ❌ **Marketing OKRs were misaligned** — They optimized for volume (SMB) vs. quality (mid-market)
3. ❌ **Too many meetings** — Weekly + bi-weekly + monthly felt like overhead
4. ❌ **G2 ranking KR was out of their control** — Depends on reviews, not directly influenceable

**Changes for Q1 2025:**
1. Simplified meeting cadence (weekly departmental, monthly leadership)
2. Removed "external ranking" KRs (can't directly control)
3. Better upfront alignment on pipeline quality (Marketing + Sales)
4. Added RACI matrix for shared KRs (expansion revenue ownership clear)

---

### Long-Term Impact (6 Months Later)

**Q1 2025:**
- Scored 0.86 average (vs. 0.78 in Q4)
- Hit $12M ARR (vs. $11M target)
- NRR reached 115% (was 85% before OKR cascade)
- Team alignment survey: 4.5/5 (was 2.8/5 before)

**COO Quote:** *"The cascade was painful to set up but it saved the company. Before, we were growing revenue but bleeding churn. Now every department knows how they contribute."*

---

## Case Study 3: When Goals Fail (And How to Recover)
### 35-Person Agency's OKR Disaster and Turnaround

**Company:** Digital marketing agency
**Stage:** Bootstrapped, profitable
**Team:** 35 people (20 client services, 8 creative, 4 ops, 3 leadership)
**Before State:** No formal goals, ran on client work and billable hours

---

### The Problem (2023)

- Agency was successful but felt "stuck"
- Revenue plateaued at $4M for 2 years
- High billable hours but no leverage
- No time for growth initiatives
- Founder wanted to implement OKRs after reading "Measure What Matters"

---

### What They Did (Q1 2024) — The Disaster

**Founder's Mistake:** Implemented OKRs top-down without team buy-in

**Q1 2024 OKRs (CEO wrote alone over a weekend):**

**Objective 1: Grow revenue 50%**
- KR1: Close $2M in new client revenue
- KR2: Increase average project size from $40K to $80K
- KR3: Upsell 10 existing clients

**Objective 2: Build productized services**
- KR1: Launch 3 packaged offerings
- KR2: 30% of revenue from productized services
- KR3: Hire 2 product managers

**Objective 3: Become a thought leader**
- KR1: Publish 24 blog posts
- KR2: 50K newsletter subscribers
- KR3: Speak at 10 conferences

**Objective 4: Improve profitability**
- KR1: Increase margins from 18% to 25%
- KR2: Reduce unbillable time 40% → 25%
- KR3: Automate 50% of reporting

**What went wrong:**

1. **Too many objectives (4)** and KRs (12)
2. **No team input** — Announced at all-hands, team had no say
3. **Unrealistic targets** — 50% revenue growth with same team?
4. **Conflicting goals** — Grow revenue + reduce unbillable time = impossible
5. **No operational plan** — How would they actually achieve these?

---

### What Happened (Q1 2024) — The Failure

**January:**
- ⚠️ Team reaction: Confusion and skepticism
- ❌ No one knew who owned what
- ❌ Client work took priority (billable hours)

**February:**
- ❌ Only 1 blog post published (vs. 8 needed)
- ❌ No progress on productized services
- ❌ New revenue: $80K (vs. $500K needed for quarter)

**March:**
- ❌ CEO gave up on OKRs by mid-month
- ❌ Team never mentioned them
- ❌ Back to firefighting client work

**Q1 Final Score: 0.15 average** (catastrophic failure)

**Founder Quote:** *"I thought OKRs would solve our growth problem. Instead, they created cynicism. The team thinks goals are a waste of time now."*

---

### The Recovery (Q2-Q3 2024)

**What Changed:**

1. **Hired external facilitator** ($3K for 2-day workshop)
2. **Involved the entire team** in goal-setting
3. **Started with "why"** — Why do we need goals? What's the problem?
4. **Ruthless prioritization** — What's the ONE thing that would change everything?

---

**Goal-Setting Workshop (2 Days, Off-Site):**

**Day 1: Diagnose the Real Problem**

**Exercise 1: "If we could only solve ONE problem this year, what would it be?"**

Answers:
- "We're at capacity but can't grow revenue"
- "Every project is custom — no leverage"
- "Talented people leave because there's no career path"
- "We're great at delivery, terrible at sales"

**Consensus:** We need **leverage** (more revenue per person)

**Exercise 2: "What would give us the most leverage?"**

Answers:
- Productized services (repeatable deliverables)
- Retainer clients (predictable revenue)
- Junior staff delivering senior-led work
- Technology/tools that reduce manual work

**Day 2: Build the Plan**

**Single Focus for Q2-Q3 (6 months): Build Leverage**

**Q2 2024 OKRs (Revised, Team Co-Created):**

**Objective: Achieve $1M ARR from retainer clients**
- KR1: Convert 8 project clients to retainers ($10K+/month each)
- KR2: 25% of revenue from retainers (currently 5%)
- KR3: Retainer churn <10%

**Initiatives (How We'll Do It):**
- Package 3 retainer offerings by Week 4
- Train sales team on retainer pitch
- Create case studies for retainer success
- Build retainer onboarding process

**That's it. One objective, three KRs, 6-month time horizon.**

---

### What Happened (Q2-Q3 2024) — The Turnaround

**Q2 (April-June):**
- ✅ Entire team rallied around ONE goal
- ✅ Converted 6 clients to retainers (vs. 8 target)
- ✅ Retainer revenue reached 18% of total (vs. 25% target)
- ✅ Churn: 0% (new retainers stuck)

**Q2 Score: 0.72** (huge improvement from 0.15)

**Q3 (July-Sept):**
- ✅ Converted 5 more clients to retainers (11 total)
- ✅ Retainer revenue reached 28% of total (exceeded target!)
- ✅ Churn: 9% (one client left, within tolerance)
- ✅ Team morale: Highest in years

**Q3 Score: 0.91**

---

### What They Learned

**Failure Lessons (Q1):**
1. ❌ **Top-down goals don't work** — Team must co-create
2. ❌ **Too many goals = no focus** — Pick ONE thing that matters most
3. ❌ **Ambition without capacity is fantasy** — Must align goals with reality
4. ❌ **Ignoring day-to-day work doesn't make it disappear** — OKRs must coexist with BAU

**Success Lessons (Q2-Q3):**
1. ✅ **Single focus is powerful** — Everyone knew what mattered
2. ✅ **6-month horizon worked better** — 90 days too short for agency retainer shift
3. ✅ **Team buy-in is everything** — Co-creation made them care
4. ✅ **Leading indicators helped** — Tracked "retainer pitches delivered" weekly

---

### Long-Term Impact (Q4 2024)

**Results:**
- Retainer ARR: $1.2M (vs. $200K in Q1)
- Total revenue: $5.2M (vs. $4M prior year)
- Profit margin: 22% (vs. 18%)
- Employee retention: 95% (vs. 70%)

**New Q4 2024 Goal:**
**Objective: Productize the retainers** (make them even more scalable)
- KR1: Create 3 tiered retainer packages (Good, Better, Best)
- KR2: 80% of retainers fit a package (vs. custom)
- KR3: Deliver retainers with 30% junior staff (currently 10%)

**Founder Quote:** *"Q1 taught us how NOT to do OKRs. Q2-Q3 showed us the power of focus. We'll never go back to running without goals."*

---

## Key Takeaways Across All Case Studies

### What Success Looks Like

1. **Start simple** — Case 1 (18 people) did Google Sheet + 15-min check-ins
2. **Involve the team** — Case 3 failed when top-down, succeeded when co-created
3. **Less is more** — All successful cases had 3-5 objectives max
4. **Weekly rhythm matters** — All cases emphasized weekly check-ins
5. **First quarter is learning** — 0.7-0.8 score is great for Q1

### Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Means | How to Fix |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| OKRs never mentioned in meetings | Goals aren't real | Make them part of weekly rituals |
| Scoring 1.0 on everything | Goals too easy | Make them stretch targets |
| Scoring <0.3 on everything | Goals unrealistic or misaligned | Reset mid-quarter if needed |
| Departments hit goals but company fails | Poor cascade | Use cross-functional review process |
| Team doesn't know the OKRs | Communication failure | All-hands updates, visible dashboard |

### When to Pivot

It's okay to change goals mid-quarter if:
- The market shifts dramatically (Case 3: COVID-like event)
- You discover the goal was based on bad data
- A dependency breaks (key hire doesn't happen)
- The goal becomes irrelevant

**Rule:** Don't pivot due to difficulty. Only pivot due to irrelevance.

---

## Your Turn: Apply These Lessons

**Questions to ask before setting your next OKRs:**

1. Are we involving the team or dictating from the top?
2. Can we focus on fewer goals? (What can we cut?)
3. Do we have capacity to execute on these?
4. Have we defined metrics clearly?
5. Is there a weekly rhythm to track progress?
6. What did we learn from last quarter?

**Remember:** The best OKR system is the one you'll actually use. Start simple, iterate, improve.
