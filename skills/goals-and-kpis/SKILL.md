# Goals & KPIs Skill

A specialised guide for defining, cascading, tracking, and reviewing business goals and key performance indicators. While the **Sales Operations Setup** skill covers end-to-end sales infrastructure, this skill zooms in on the *goal-setting and measurement discipline* that every function — sales, marketing, product, customer success, finance, or HR — needs to operate effectively.

**NEW:** This skill now includes **Small Company Quick Start** guidance (5-50 people) with simplified frameworks, templates, and real-world case studies showing both successes and failures.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start by Company Size

**Choose your starting point:**

### For 5-20 People: Small Company Quick Start
→ **Read:** `references/small-company-quick-start.md`

Start with **Simple OKRs** (3 company objectives, no cascade):
- 30-minute setup with Google Sheets
- 15-minute Monday check-ins
- No fancy tools needed
- Real examples from 5-50 person companies

### For 20-100 People: Scaling OKRs
→ **Read:** This SKILL.md (full guide)

Use **2-Level Cascade** (Company → Department):
- OKRs with department alignment
- Weekly + monthly review cadence
- Notion or Asana for tracking
- Department dashboards

### For 100+ People: Enterprise Goal Systems
→ **Read:** `references/framework-comparison.md` + `templates/goal-map.md`

Consider **Goal Map + OKR Hybrid**:
- Annual Goal Map (strategic alignment)
- Quarterly OKRs (execution)
- Full review cadence (weekly → annual)
- Enterprise BI dashboards

---

## 🎯 Consultative Approach: Discovery Before Prescription

**IMPORTANT**: This skill uses a **consultative, discovery-first approach**. Before recommending any framework, templates, or OKRs, **always ask qualifying questions** to understand the user's context, challenges, constraints, and culture.

### Discovery-First Workflow

**Step 1: Quick Context (2-3 questions)**
- Company size and stage
- Current goal-setting state (have something / have nothing / have something broken)
- Primary objective (Why now? What's the pain?)

**Step 2: Deep Discovery (5-8 questions)**
- Organization structure and culture
- Current processes and what's working/not working
- Strategic priorities and success criteria
- Resources and constraints (time, budget, tools)
- Team readiness and leadership commitment

**Step 3: Synthesize & Recommend**
Only after understanding their context, provide:
- Recommended framework (and why it fits)
- Implementation scope and timeline
- Specific templates and tools
- Risk mitigation for their concerns

### Key Discovery Questions to Ask

**Organization Context:**
- "Tell me about your company — how many people, what stage, what industry?"
- "How is your team structured? What functions exist?"

**Current State:**
- "Do you have a goal-setting process today? What does it look like?"
- "What's working well? What's frustrating or not working?"
- "When did you last review or update your goals?"

**Strategic Context:**
- "What are your top 2-3 strategic priorities for the next 12 months?"
- "What's driving the need for goals/KPIs right now?"
- "What does success look like 12 months from now?"

**Culture & Readiness:**
- "How do decisions typically get made? Top-down or collaborative?"
- "Have you tried implementing OKRs or similar frameworks before? What happened?"
- "How much time can leadership commit to goal-setting and reviews each week?"

**Constraints & Resources:**
- "What's your timeline? When do you need goals in place?"
- "Do you have a budget for goal-setting tools?"
- "What tools do you currently use?" (Notion, Asana, spreadsheets, etc.)

**→ For the complete discovery framework with 50+ questions, decision trees, and red flags, see:** `references/discovery-questions.md`

### Why Discovery Matters

**Anti-pattern**: Jumping straight to "Here are your OKRs" without understanding:
- Current goal-setting maturity
- Team culture and buy-in
- Existing processes and tools
- Available time and resources
- Leadership support and commitment

**Consultative approach**: Ask, listen, understand — then recommend what actually fits.

**Example**:
- ❌ **Bad**: User says "help me set OKRs" → You immediately draft 5 company objectives
- ✅ **Good**: User says "help me set OKRs" → You ask: "Tell me about your company size, current goal process, and what's prompting this now?" → Then recommend based on their answers

| **V2MOM** | Salesforce-style alignment | Annual + quarterly | 5 layers |
| **4DX** (4 Disciplines of Execution) | Operational teams with daily cadence | Weekly | WIG + Lead Measures |
| **EOS Rocks** | SMB / entrepreneurial orgs | 90-day cycles | 3-7 Rocks |
| **Goal Map** | Cross-functional strategic alignment | Annual + quarterly | Purpose → BIG Goals → Measurable Goals → Metrics Map |

**This skill will**:
- Recommend the best framework for your company size, stage, and culture
- Generate the full goal tree (company → department → team → individual)
- Define measurable Key Results / KPIs for every objective
- Create alignment maps showing how individual goals ladder up

### 1b. Goal Map Framework

A **Goal Map** is a single-page strategic planning tool that aligns every function around the company's most important objectives. It combines qualitative vision with measurable targets, risk analysis, and an operational metrics map.

#### Functional View — One Row per Function

The Goal Map lays out the following rows for **each function** (Corporate, Sales, Strategy & Ops, Marketing, Client Success, Services/Interactive, Product, Technology, Finance & Admin, Human Resources):

| Row | What It Captures | Example (Sales) |
|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| **Purpose** | Why the function exists — its mission in one sentence | "The engine of new and sustainable growth; relentless promoter of the brand" |
| **BIG Goals** | Aspirational, qualitative outcomes (2-3 year horizon) | "The team is delivering net new growth consistently MoM; we gain recognised brands from top competitors" |
| **Measurable Goals** | Specific, quantifiable targets for the current year/quarter | "Define and achieve Q4 new logo goals; achieve target 1/1 pipeline; achieve cost structure goals" |
| **Key Questions** | Critical questions that must be answered to succeed | "Do we have the right ICP? Is our sales motion scalable?" |
| **Critical Success Factors** | What must go right for the plan to work | "Hire 5 AEs by end of Q1; complete sales training programme" |
| **Critical Assumptions** | What we're taking as given (but could be wrong) | "Market demand stays strong; competitors don't drop prices" |
| **Risks** | What could go wrong | "Key hires don't materialise; pipeline generation falls short" |
| **Mitigating Actions** | Proactive steps to reduce risk | "Engage 2 recruiters; build outbound pipeline as backup" |
| **Open Questions** | Unresolved items that need answers | "What is the right comp plan? Do we need a sales engineer?" |

**This skill will**:
- Generate a complete Goal Map template for your company
- Pre-populate purpose statements and BIG Goals for each function
- Help you fill in key questions, critical success factors, and risks
- Link the Goal Map to a detailed **Metrics Map** (see below)

#### Metrics Map — The Operational KPI Registry

The Metrics Map is the companion to the Goal Map. It lists **every KPI by function** with operational detail:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **KPI Name** | Clear, concise metric name |
| **Defined By** | Source system or calculation method |
| **Goal / Target** | Quantified target (absolute, %, or baseline) |
| **Implementation Date** | When tracking begins |
| **Data Source** | Where the data lives (CRM, analytics, manual, etc.) |
| **Measurement Frequency** | Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Quarterly / Semi-annual / Annually |
| **Comments** | Context, caveats, known limitations |
| **Next Steps** | Actions needed to operationalise this KPI |

### 3. Goal Cascading & Alignment

Ensure every team's goals connect to the company mission:

```
Company Vision & Purpose
  └─ BIG Goals (aspirational, 2-3 year)
       └─ Annual Strategic Priorities (3-5)
            └─ Measurable Goals per Function
                 └─ Quarterly OKRs / Rocks by Department
                      └─ Team-level OKRs
                           └─ Individual OKRs / Goals
```

For each level, capture the **full strategic context**:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Why does this function / team exist? |
| **BIG Goals** | Aspirational outcomes (success looks like…) |
| **Measurable Goals** | Specific, quantified targets |
| **Key Questions** | Critical unknowns that must be answered |
| **Critical Success Factors** | What must go right |
| **Critical Assumptions** | What we're assuming — and could be wrong |
| **Risks** | What could derail us |
| **Mitigating Actions** | How we'll proactively reduce risk |
| **Open Questions** | Unresolved items needing decisions |

**This skill will**:
- Build a visual cascade map
- Identify misalignments and orphan goals
- Suggest cross-functional dependencies
- Create RACI matrices for shared objectives
- Define contribution weights for shared KPIs
- Generate a Goal Map (Functional View) showing all functions side-by-side
- Link each function's goals to its Metrics Map KPIs

### 4. Dashboards & Reporting Blueprints

Design actionable dashboards at every level:

#### Executive / Board Dashboard
| Section | Metrics | Refresh |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Revenue health | ARR, NRR, pipeline coverage | Weekly |
| Customer health | NPS, churn, expansion | Monthly |
| Efficiency | CAC payback, burn multiple, Rule of 40 | Monthly |
| People | Headcount vs. plan, attrition, engagement | Monthly |

#### Department Dashboard
| Section | Metrics | Refresh |
|---------|---------|---------|
| OKR / Rock progress | % complete, confidence score | Weekly |
| Leading indicators | Activities, pipeline gen, feature velocity | Daily |
| Lagging indicators | Revenue closed, churn, NPS | Monthly |
| Health alerts | Red / amber / green status | Real-time |

#### Individual / 1:1 Dashboard
| Section | Metrics | Refresh |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Personal OKR progress | KR scores (0 – 1.0) | Weekly |
| Activity tracker | Calls, meetings, PRs, tickets | Daily |
| Development goals | Skill milestones, certifications | Quarterly |

### 5. Review Cadences & Rituals

Build the operating rhythm that keeps goals alive:

| Cadence | Purpose | Participants | Duration |
|---------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Daily stand-up** | Blockers, priorities | Team | 15 min |
| **Weekly check-in** | OKR progress, leading indicators | Manager + team | 30 min |
| **Monthly business review** | Department health, course-correct | Dept. head + leadership | 60 min |
| **Quarterly planning** | Set next quarter OKRs / Rocks | All leaders | Half-day |
| **Annual strategy session** | Vision, priorities, annual goals | Exec team | 1-2 days |
| **QBR (Quarterly Business Review)** | Full-funnel review, win/loss, forecast | Exec + board | 90 min |

**This skill will generate**:
- Agenda templates for each cadence
- OKR scoring guides (0.0 – 1.0 scale)
- Retrospective question sets
- Goal-setting workshop facilitation guides

### 6. Scoring & Confidence Models

Quantify goal progress honestly:

#### OKR Scoring Guide
| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 0.0 | Not started | No progress |
| 0.1 – 0.3 | Off track | Significant gaps, needs intervention |
| 0.4 – 0.6 | At risk | Some progress, unlikely to hit fully |
| 0.7 – 0.8 | On track | Stretch target being met — this is "good" in OKR |
| 0.9 – 1.0 | Exceeded | Achieved or surpassed — re-evaluate if ambitious enough |

#### Confidence Rating (for forecasting & reviews)
| Colour | Level | Meaning | Action |
|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| 🟢 Green | High (> 80 %) | On track to achieve | Maintain cadence |
| 🟡 Amber | Medium (50-80 %) | At risk | Intervention plan needed |
| 🔴 Red | Low (< 50 %) | Off track | Escalate, re-prioritise, or reset |

### 7. Anti-Patterns & Common Mistakes

Avoid the traps that kill goal programmes:

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| **Too many goals** | No focus, everything is a priority | Max 3-5 objectives per level |
| **Vanity KPIs** | Look good but don't drive decisions | Every KPI must trigger an action |
| **Set-and-forget** | Goals go stale by week 3 | Weekly check-ins are non-negotiable |
| **Sandbagging** | Easy goals kill ambition | OKRs should hit ~70 % (stretch) |
| **Cascading without context** | Copy-paste goals lose meaning | Each level re-writes in their own language |
| **Lagging-only metrics** | You see the problem too late | Pair every lagging KPI with a leading indicator |
| **No ownership** | "Everyone's goal" = nobody's goal | Single DRI for every objective |
| **Measuring activity, not outcome** | "100 calls" ≠ revenue | Measure results, track activities separately |

**→ For 20+ before/after examples with detailed fixes, see:** `references/okr-anti-patterns.md`

This includes common mistakes like:
- Vague objectives ("Improve the product")
- Activities disguised as KRs ("Hire 5 people")
- Too many objectives (10+ per quarter)
- No connection between objectives and KRs
- Business-as-usual disguised as OKRs
- And complete rewrites showing how to fix them

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- **Define company / team / individual goals** for the quarter or year
- **Select a goal-setting framework** (OKR, SMART, BSC, V2MOM, 4DX, EOS Rocks)
- **Design KPIs** for any function (sales, marketing, product, CS, finance, HR)
- **Build dashboards** that your team will actually look at
- **Cascade goals** from company down to individual
- **Set up review cadences** (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- **Score and grade** goal progress
- **Run a goal-setting workshop** or offsite
- **Diagnose** why goals aren't being met
- **Align cross-functional teams** on shared objectives

---

## How It Works

When you invoke this skill, Claude will follow a **consultative, discovery-first process**:

### Phase 1: Discovery & Qualification (5-10 minutes)
1. **Ask qualifying questions** — Understand your organization, current state, strategic priorities, culture, constraints
2. **Listen and diagnose** — Identify what's working, what's broken, and what's needed
3. **Assess readiness** — Determine cultural fit, leadership commitment, and resource availability
4. **Identify red flags** — Surface risks that could cause failure (no leadership time, cultural resistance, unrealistic timeline)

**→ See `references/discovery-questions.md` for the complete discovery framework**

### Phase 2: Recommendation & Planning (10-15 minutes)
5. **Recommend a framework** — OKR, SMART, BSC, EOS Rocks, or hybrid based on your context (with explanation of why it fits)
6. **Define scope** — Company-level only? Cascade to departments? How many objectives?
7. **Propose timeline** — Setup, rollout, review cadence
8. **Suggest tools** — Based on budget and existing tools
9. **Address concerns** — Mitigate risks you identified

### Phase 3: Implementation & Execution (Ongoing)
10. **Draft goals** — Objectives, key results, and KPIs tailored to your business
11. **Build the cascade** — Company → department → team → individual (if appropriate)
12. **Design dashboards** — Metrics, layout, refresh cadence (if data available)
13. **Create review rituals** — Agendas, scoring guides, retrospectives
14. **Identify leading indicators** — So you know early if you're on/off track
15. **Generate templates** — Customized for your organization

**Key principle: Discovery before prescription. Understanding before recommendation. Fit over framework.**

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quarterly OKR Planning for a Startup (Discovery-First Approach)

**User**: "Help me set Q2 OKRs for my 30-person B2B SaaS startup"

**Claude will** (Discovery Phase):
1. **Ask discovery questions first**:
   - "Do you have a goal-setting process today? What does it look like?"
   - "What are your top 2-3 strategic priorities for Q2?"
   - "What's prompting you to implement OKRs now?"
   - "How is your 30-person team structured? What functions exist?"
   - "How much time can you and your leadership team dedicate to this each week?"
   - "Have you tried OKRs before? What happened?"

2. **Based on your answers, recommend an approach**:
   - If starting from scratch → Simple OKRs (3 company objectives, no cascade yet)
   - If have goals but misaligned → Full cascade (company → department)
   - If tried before and failed → Diagnose root cause first

3. **Then implement**:
   - Draft 3-4 company-level objectives with 3-5 KRs each (customized to your priorities)
   - Cascade into department OKRs (Sales, Engineering, Marketing, CS) if appropriate
   - Suggest leading metrics to track weekly
   - Create a scoring template for end-of-quarter grading
   - Design a weekly check-in agenda that fits your culture
   - Address any concerns you raised (e.g., "worried nobody will use it")

### Example 2: Building a KPI Dashboard

- Define formulas and data sources for each KPI
- Design dashboard layout with sections and visualisation types
- Set RAG thresholds (red/amber/green) for each metric
- Specify refresh cadence and data owners
- Suggest alerting rules for anomalies

### Example 3: Annual Strategy → Goal Cascade

**User**: "We want to grow ARR from $5M to $10M. Help me cascade this into team goals"

**Claude will**:
- Break down the $10M target into new business, expansion, and retention
- Assign revenue targets to Sales (new logo), CS (expansion/renewal)
- Identify Marketing pipeline contributions needed
- Define Product goals to reduce churn and increase adoption
- Create Engineering capacity goals for feature delivery
- Set HR/People goals for hiring the team to execute
- Build a RACI matrix for cross-functional dependencies

### Example 4: Goal-Setting Workshop Facilitation

**Claude will**:
- Create a detailed agenda with time blocks
- Prepare vision/mission review prompts
- Design breakout exercises for priority identification
- Build a template for drafting OKRs collaboratively
- Create alignment exercises (dependency mapping)
- Prepare voting/prioritisation frameworks (dot voting, impact/effort)
- Design follow-up action items and accountability plan

### Example 5: Diagnosing Goal Failure

**User**: "Our Q1 goals all came in at 30-40 %. What went wrong?"

**Claude will**:
- Run a diagnostic framework (ambition, alignment, ownership, cadence, data)
- Identify root causes (too many goals? wrong metrics? no check-ins?)
- Compare leading vs. lagging indicators to find where things broke down
- Suggest corrective actions for Q2
- Redesign review cadences to catch issues earlier

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works alongside:

| Skill | How They Connect |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Sales Operations Setup** | Goals & KPIs defines the *what* to measure; Sales Ops defines *how* to run the sales engine |
| **CRM / LeadGenius** | KPIs pull data from CRM; goals drive CRM configuration |
| **Forecasting** | Revenue goals feed forecast models; forecast accuracy is a KPI |

---

## Getting Started

When you invoke this skill, **you don't need to prepare everything upfront**. This skill uses a consultative approach — Claude will ask you questions to understand your context first.

However, if you want to be prepared, consider these areas:

1. **Company context** — Stage, size, industry, business model
2. **Current state** — Do you have goals today? What's working/not working?
3. **Why now** — What's prompting you to set up or improve goals?
4. **Constraints** — Time, budget, tools, resources available
5. **Success criteria** — How will you know this is working?

**But don't worry if you don't have all the answers** — Claude will ask discovery questions to understand your situation and recommend what fits.
